# Some misc scripting i thought of while at shopee


Game1 - remember the number which increases in length by 1 each time
Game2 - remember whether a word has appeared before
card_v1 - inspired by Shopee's christmas lucky draw. I made it virtual
lucky_draw - inspired by Shopee's lunar new year lucky draw. I made it virtual and implemented a better way of allocating the probability distributions.
